      <p>The current Fortnite season introduces major map changes including a futuristic biome, vertical combat zones, and floating islands. Notable new locations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Order Base</strong> – The First Order has claimed a mountaintop to house its imposing base of operations, which includes a hangar for repairing damaged First Order TIE fighters. There are five entrances, but its utility shaft is its main point of weakness and where you’ll find it easiest to sneak in..</li>
        <li><strong>Outpost Enclave</strong> – There’s an element of danger to the Outpost Enclave, a boisterous hub of smuggler activity where tensions are known to run high. While you’re in the area, check out the interior of the parked sandcrawler nearby.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance Base</strong> – The underground Resistance command center is shrouded in foliage, hiding the facility's location from any ships passing overhead. Here, you’ll find X-wings and a ton of handy equipment for taking on the First Order’s fleet. </li>
      </ul>

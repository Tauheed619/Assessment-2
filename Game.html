      <p>Fortnite is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed by Epic Games. Players drop onto an island with up to 100 others and must gather resources, build structures, and fight to be the last one standing. The game features different modes such as Solo, Duo, Squads, Zero Build, and Creative Mode where players can design their own games and maps.</p>

      <p>One of Fortnite’s most unique aspects is its fast-paced building mechanic, allowing players to quickly construct walls, ramps, and forts for both defense and mobility during combat.</p>

      <p>Fortnite frequently updates with new content including weapons, limited-time modes (LTMs), themed events, and collaborations with major franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and anime series.</p>

      <p>The term “OG Fortnite” refers to the early days of the game—specifically Chapter 1, Seasons 1 to 10. This era of Fortnite was known for its simpler graphics, limited loot pool, and a rapidly evolving map that introduced players to an evolving narrative and dynamic live events.</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 1, Season 1:</strong> Launched in 2017, this season featured no Battle Pass and a small selection of weapons and cosmetics. The map was basic with iconic locations like Retail Row and Pleasant Park.</p>

      <p><strong>Season 4:</strong> Introduced the first true narrative arc with a meteor crash and the rise of super-powered skins. This was the season that truly brought lore to the game.</p>

      <p><strong>Season 9 and 10:</strong> These seasons built up to the "The End" event which concluded Chapter 1 by sucking the entire map into a black hole, resulting in a brief downtime before launching Chapter 2.</p>

      <p>Many players fondly remember OG Fortnite for its simplicity, iconic POIs (Points of Interest), and community-driven culture. Epic Games has since revisited these seasons through limited events that bring back the classic map and loot pool temporarily.</p>

      <p><strong>Chapter 2 and Beyond:</strong> Chapter 2 introduced new swimming mechanics, boats, and a complete overhaul of the island map. It also expanded the narrative further with spy themes, live Galactus events, and the integration of the Zero Point storyline. Chapter 3 brought weather mechanics, sliding, and new traversal tools, making gameplay more dynamic.</p>
